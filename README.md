An algorithm to study the change in droplet number and their size over time, formed after the disintegration of a parent droplet. 

The algorithm was created to facilitate the study of one of the tasks of the Young Physicists 2022 Tournament.

The algorithm analyzes the video using the OpenCV library. The methods used are contour finding and HoughCircles finding.

The results of the analysis of one of the recordings are shown below:
